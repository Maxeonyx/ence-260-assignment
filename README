Hi, welcome to:

MATHS FIGHT!

It's a game, where you put your brain to the test, and battle it out with MATHS.

How to play:

1. Have a friend. If you do not have friend, this is tragic.

2. Install MATHS FIGHT on both Fun Kits.

3. One player (you) should press the navswitch to begin. They will be prompted to enter in a question.

4. Secretly enter your question.

5. Send it to your friend with Button 1

6. Your friend will now have to answer the question! They can use left/right to change the number by 10

6.5. There is a timer on your screen! If your friend is too slow then they will lose!

7. Repeat! Perhaps you should let your friend start this time?
